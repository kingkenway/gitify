Github repositories clone page.

You would need to insert your read only token from Developer Settings e.g "f1033hgy6767d8009517a8cb1969acaf62a05c72" in the Bearer Header at src/js/script.js, to load data from GraphQL successfully.

Also to test this out, clone this repository to your machine, and perform the above to view the page on your local machine. 
Regards.
