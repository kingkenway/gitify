Github repositories clone page.

Hi, you would need to insert this read only token "464402eea526820aa1dae11db570b1d473fdd010" in the Bearer Header at src/js/script.js, to load data from GraphQL successfully.

Also to test this out, clone this repository to your machine, and perform the above to view the completed challenge.

Regards.
