Github repositories clone page.

You would need to insert your reead only token e.g "f1033hgy6767d8009517a8cb1969acaf62a05c72" in the Bearer Header at src/js/script.js, to load data from GraphQL successfully. You would have to do this because, once committed to the repo, and it becomes deactivated.

Also to test this out, clone this repository to your machine, and perform the above to view the completed challenge.
