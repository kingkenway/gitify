Github repositories clone page.

Hi, you would need to insert this read only token "f10331461d77d8009517a8cb1969acaf62a05c72" in the Bearer Header at src/js/script.js, to load data from GraphQL successfully. You would have to do this because, I previously committed this token to the repo, and it became deactivated.

Also to test this out, clone this repository to your machine, and perform the above to view the completed challenge.
Regards.
